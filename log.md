**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1 
07-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
-Learnt how to comment out lines of code using Githubs markdown
-Used @Override to change backButton behaviour in Cash Buckets app.  There are two activity screens in Cash Buckets, from the second screen if the user presses the back button it goes back to the main screen.  From the main screen it now exits the app.

**Thoughts** I've read that you should never change the onBackPressed but I think that what I've done will be closer to what the user expects.
The other thing I tried but did not succeed at was creating a branch of Cash Buckets that I can share publicly.  There are files within it that have densitive details.  Ideally I would like to have one private branch that has the whole project.  Another one that has the two .java files and the two .xml files

### Day 2 
08-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Updated Cash Buckets app to display warnig before user deletes bucket
- Added menu to Cash Buckets

**Thoughts** 
Adding the warning was very easy.
Adding the menu wasn't hard but Android Studio doesn't seem to autocomplete onCreateOptionsMenu() or onOptionsItemSelected(). Having minor spelling mistakes are just as good as typing something completely different.  Once recognised it was easy to fix.
I still need to find a good way to share some of the project publicly on Github while at the same keeping certain files private.
