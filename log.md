**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1 
07-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
-Learnt how to comment out lines of code using Githubs markdown
-Used @Override to change backButton behaviour in Cash Buckets app.  There are two activity screens in Cash Buckets, from the second screen if the user presses the back button it goes back to the main screen.  From the main screen it now exits the app.

**Thoughts** I've read that you should never change the onBackPressed but I think that what I've done will be closer to what the user expects.
The other thing I tried but did not succeed at was creating a branch of Cash Buckets that I can share publicly.  There are files within it that have densitive details.  Ideally I would like to have one private branch that has the whole project.  Another one that has the two .java files and the two .xml files

### Day 2 
08-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Updated Cash Buckets app to display warnig before user deletes bucket
- Added menu to Cash Buckets

**Thoughts** 
Adding the warning was very easy.
Adding the menu wasn't hard but Android Studio doesn't seem to autocomplete onCreateOptionsMenu() or onOptionsItemSelected(). Having minor spelling mistakes are just as good as typing something completely different.  Once recognised it was easy to fix.
I still need to find a good way to share some of the project publicly on Github while at the same keeping certain files private.

### Day 3 
09-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Added reset function to Cash Buckets

**Thoughts** 
I need to clean up my code to make it more readable.  It was one of those days where things did not go as smoothly as I would expect.  I seemed to have difficulty executing a function that isn't that complicated.  I feel like I made very minimal progress today.

### Day 4 
10-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Created public repository for CashBuckets

**Thoughts** 
I though that committing a forked repository would count on Github's contribution graph.  Apparently not, yesterday I did not commit anything according to Github.

I created a new project in Android Studio and copied my CashBuckets code across.  Slightly nervous about showing my code to the world (or more accurately one or two people), my code works but it could be a lot cleaner.

### Day 5
11-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Small experiment to test animation

**Thoughts** 
I want to make an animation that fills a shape with colour, from the bottom to the top.  I feel like this should be an easy task but so far I have not found out how to do it.  Amount of progress has been dissapointing today.  I'll come back to it another time.

### Day 6
12-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Changed a couple of EditText fields in CashBuckets to display their values
- On switiching to the edit bucket activity the cursor is now in the bucket name field

**Thoughts** 
My Cash Buckets app is still nowhere near how I imagine the finished product.  But it is getting incrementally better.  Today I worked on a couple of relatively easy problems.

### Day 7
13-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Created Spinner for the Cash Buckets app

**Thoughts** 
It's been a little while since dealing with ArrayAdapters. Forgot how to work with them ,not too hard though.  It took longer than I expected but I've got most of the results I wanted, next time I'll make them look a bit better.

### Day 8
14-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Started new project called I Am Listening

**Thoughts** 
I tried to name this app "I'mListening", I knew that it's not a good idea to name files or directory's with punctuation in them.  I tried to anyway thinking that Android Studio would tell me if it was going to cause any problems.  I wrote a bit, then tried to run it on the emulator.  Wouldn't work.  I deleted the project and started again, as a result my progress today is making a few buttons that display Toasts.
