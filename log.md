# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1 
07-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
-Learnt how to comment out lines of code using Githubs markdown
-Used @Override to change backButton behaviour in Cash Buckets app.  There are two activity screens in Cash Buckets, from the second screen if the user presses the back button it goes back to the main screen.  From the main screen it now exits the app.

**Thoughts** I've read that you should never change the onBackPressed but I think that what I've done will be closer to what the user expects.
The other thing I tried but did not succeed at was creating a branch of Cash Buckets that I can share publicly.  There are files within it that have densitive details.  Ideally I would like to have one private branch that has the whole project.  Another one that has the two .java files and the two .xml files

### Day 2 
08-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Updated Cash Buckets app to display warnig before user deletes bucket
- Added menu to Cash Buckets

**Thoughts** 
Adding the warning was very easy.
Adding the menu wasn't hard but Android Studio doesn't seem to autocomplete onCreateOptionsMenu() or onOptionsItemSelected(). Having minor spelling mistakes are just as good as typing something completely different.  Once recognised it was easy to fix.
I still need to find a good way to share some of the project publicly on Github while at the same keeping certain files private.

### Day 3 
09-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Added reset function to Cash Buckets

**Thoughts** 
I need to clean up my code to make it more readable.  It was one of those days where things did not go as smoothly as I would expect.  I seemed to have difficulty executing a function that isn't that complicated.  I feel like I made very minimal progress today.

### Day 4 
10-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Created public repository for CashBuckets

**Thoughts** 
I though that committing a forked repository would count on Github's contribution graph.  Apparently not, yesterday I did not commit anything according to Github.

I created a new project in Android Studio and copied my CashBuckets code across.  Slightly nervous about showing my code to the world (or more accurately one or two people), my code works but it could be a lot cleaner.

### Day 5
11-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Small experiment to test animation

**Thoughts** 
I want to make an animation that fills a shape with colour, from the bottom to the top.  I feel like this should be an easy task but so far I have not found out how to do it.  Amount of progress has been dissapointing today.  I'll come back to it another time.

### Day 6
12-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Changed a couple of EditText fields in CashBuckets to display their values
- On switiching to the edit bucket activity the cursor is now in the bucket name field

**Thoughts** 
My Cash Buckets app is still nowhere near how I imagine the finished product.  But it is getting incrementally better.  Today I worked on a couple of relatively easy problems.

### Day 7
13-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Created Spinner for the Cash Buckets app

**Thoughts** 
It's been a little while since dealing with ArrayAdapters. Forgot how to work with them ,not too hard though.  It took longer than I expected but I've got most of the results I wanted, next time I'll make them look a bit better.

### Day 8
14-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Started new project called I Am Listening

**Thoughts** 
I tried to name this app "I'mListening", I knew that it's not a good idea to name files or directory's with punctuation in them.  I tried to anyway thinking that Android Studio would tell me if it was going to cause any problems.  I wrote a bit, then tried to run it on the emulator.  Wouldn't work.  I deleted the project and started again, as a result my progress today is making a few buttons that display Toasts.

### Day 9
15-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Updated Cash Buckets to version 1.1.2 Buckets previously created will display the name and max cash in the editTexts

**Thoughts** 
Cash Buckets is incrementally better.  Would have like to do a lot more to it, but don't have a lot of time today.  Also I'd like to get it out to more people so that I can get more feedback on how to make it better.  Paying for advertising doesn't seem like a great idea considering it's a free app with no ads.

### Day 10
17-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Added class specific methods, Cash Buckets will display a random quote on the edit bucket screen

**Thoughts** 
I missed a day of coding yesterday, was sick.  Still not 100% so I worked on something that's relatively easy today.  Implementing a class method that returns a random quote depending on which class it is.  Some of the code is repeated from each class but it is only two lines andI don't think it would make sense to create another method.

### Day 11
18-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Added random quotes to the edit bucket screen in the beta version

**Thoughts** 
Fairly simple stuff, tomorrow I'll have to work on something a little more challenging.  Only minor hurdle with today's coding was to remember that including a " in a String requires \". ie. String stringName = "\"I got 99 problems\"";

### Day 12
19-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Added menu and the reset feature in Cash Buckets now works

**Thoughts** 
My code is starting to get unruly, it works but keeping track of what goes where is getting harder.  I'm also sure that there is plenty of duplicate code in there too.  I'll work on that tomorrow.

### Day 13
20-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Tried working with JavaScript

**Thoughts** 
Gorillaz and Jaguar inserted a job application into the Gorillaz app.  One of the gifs in the challenge had a Github account in a frame.  I followed it, surprisingly I was one of the first to fork the repository.  Even at the time of this entry there are only 7 followers and it's been forked 5 times.  The branches contain broken javascript, so I tried to fix it.  Didn't get far, but found the function that's missing some code.

### Day 14
21-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Tried getting that Gorillaz file to work again

**Thoughts** 
I have a rough idea of what needs to be done to get it to work.  There's a function that needs a couple of descrambling functions added.  I'm still surprised that there are so few people who have forked the repository.

### Day 15
22-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Updated production version of Cash Buckets to 1.3.0
- Updated beta version of Cash Buckets to 1.4.0, now has a menu that resets the app

**Thoughts** 
I should tidy up my code but I have no trouble working out which functions do what.  It could be ordered slightly better but I'm not sure that it's that bad.  It's just more fun to right features rather than tidy up.

### Day 16
23-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Found ways that don't work

**Thoughts** 
Just accidently deleted this entry.  No undo button when you're entering it straigh onto the website.
Anyway, tried to get the square to "fill up" so that at 50% the top half would be a light shade.  I haven't found an easy way to do that in Android Studio yet

### Day 17
24-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Played around a little with Kotlin in Android Studio

**Thoughts** 
So far I'm not liking Kotlin.  I haven't found that it's easier to work with compared to Java.  Maybe that's because I'm used to working with Java.

### Day 18
25-June-17

***Today's progress***: 
- Fixed a very basic function and submitted pull request on Github

**Thoughts** 
Still can't figure out how to solve the Gorillaz javascript puzzle.  I've got a rough idea of what I need to do but it's a little beyond my capabilities for now
